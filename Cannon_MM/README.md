# Mini-report
## Problem Description
This project the task was to implement Matrix-Matrix multiplication algorithm using
either Cannon or BMR methods. Performance of the implemented algorithm would then be
assessed with various number of processes P [ 1 , $2^{2}$ , $2^{4}$ , $2^{6}$ ] and various matrix sizes N
[ $2^{8}$ , $2^{10}$ , $2^{12}$ ] I stopped at $2^{12}$ since after that I get memory errors.
## Program
I used python as my programing language using mpi4py. I am implementing Cannon
which is also known as Row-Partition A, Column-Partition B. As the second name suggest, how
this process works is by partitioning A by rows and partitioning B by columns. Then after
computing the partitioned multiplication rows of A are rolled up by a processor unit or partition
size while keeping B partitions unchanged. This process is repeated until all values of C have
been computed. A benefit of this method is that for each value of C ie C11 there is no need for
additions across processes since each process gets a partition of rows of A and columns of B.

My algorithm starts out with the creation of the matrices A and B using numpy uniform
and only process 0 would have full A and B. Wtime is called to get the start time before calling
cannon. Cannon performs numpy matmul of A and B if the number of processes is 1 and if the
number of processes is not a perfect square raise an error. Passing the first 2 conditions cannon
process is initiated where number of rows per partition is calcauted and A is scattered among
processes. I couldn‚Äôt scatter B across processes due to what I believe scatter does partition by
rows rather than columns therefore I partitioned B manually across processes. This concludes the
initial partitioning phase each process has its own local_A and local_B representing their
respective partitions of A and B.

Multiplication and rollup phase is a for loop looping number of processes times.
Local_C is computed by numpy matmul of local_A and local_B and added to a list called
local_C_list. Since the computation of C is filled in a lower diagonal manner as in:

| Step 1 	| Step 3 	| Step 2 	|
|---------|---------|---------|
| Step 2 	| Step 1 	| Step 3 	|
| Step 3 	| Step 2 	| Step 1 	|

The addition of local_C to local_C_list is added to the beginning of local_C_list if
inequality step >= size ‚Äì rank is satisfied this if not then local_C is appended to the end of
local_C_list this ensures that local_C_list are in order and ready for concatenation. For the
rolling up of A I used the MPI tool Sendrecv_replace this allows each process to efficiently
rollup A without taking in extra space.

The final step is constructing C where each respective local_C_list is concatenated after
concluding the for loop. The result of concatenation is a vector per process those are gathered
into process 0 and concatenated to finalize the construction of matrix C. After finishing up the
cannon algorithm Wtime is called for the end time where root 0 would compute and output the
time taken cannon for each P and N combination.

Additionally, the Slurm script is designed to iterate through the number of processors. As
a result, when running the Python script, two loops are executed: one for the processors specified
in the Slurm file and another for the matrix size within the Python file. This allows for a
comprehensive evaluation of performance.
## Results
I extracted data from the output file, which was in the format "N = %d, P = %d, Cannon
time elapsed = %f." Using these values, I generated Table 1, which includes not only the
extracted values but also the speedup calculated as ùëÜ= $ùëá_1/ùëá_ùëÉ$ where $ùëá_1$ is time elapsed for a single
process and $ùëá_ùëÉ$ is time elapsed for P processes for a given N. Finally, I generated the Speedup
plot in Figure 1.

## Analysis
Here we compared the elapsed time and speedup of Cannon functions across different
number of processors and matrix sizes. As shown in Figure 1 the speed up increases with number
of processes if the matrix size was big as shown in the green line where N = 4096 the line is
close to ideal speedup of slope = 1. However, for smaller matrix size the speedup diminishes as it
goes to 0 as the number of processes increases. In class Dr. Deng was surprised by how fast P =
1 and N = 4096 was computed in around 14 seconds. I used numpy.multmal which I believe is
optimized to compute matrix multiplication in a very time efficient manner.
