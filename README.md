# Parallel Computing Principles Projects

## Introduction

Welcome! This repository contains projects completed for a parallel computing principles class. These projects explore various techniques for parallel programming and their applications in solving computational problems.

## Projects

1. [Deterministic Output](Daterministic_Output):
   * This project investigates the concept of deterministic output in parallel programs. It explores how to ensure consistency in the final results despite concurrent execution.
3. [MPI_Bcast() vs. MY_Bcast()](MPI_Bcast()_vs_MY_Bcast()):
   * This project compares the built-in MPI_Bcast() function with a custom MY_Bcast() implementation. It analyzes performance and potential benefits of the custom function.
5. [Matrix Multiplication using Cannon Method](Cannon_MM):
   * This project implements the Canon method, Row-Partition A & Column-Partition B, for parallel matrix multiplication. It explores how to distribute and process matrix elements effectively across multiple processors.
7. [Molecular Dynamics Energy Reduction](MD_Energy_Reduction):
   * This project simulates a molecular dynamics system and aim reduce the energy of a given system of particles by kicking them around basically a truncated Monte Carlo with emphasis on parallelization of energy calculation.
